# NashvilleHousing-Data-Cleaning-project

This project shows the step by step process I took in cleaning up the data obtained from Nashville Housing.

The major purpose of this is to ensure that the data is normalized, standardized and properly ready for analysis.

I uploaded the Dataset on SQL Server where I cleaned the data using SQL.
